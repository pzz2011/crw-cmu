#summary Vehicle hardware interface specifications.

= Introduction =

There are two primary types of connectors available on the vehicles, a *sensor* connector which provides a low-power logic supply and bidirectional IO of several types, and the *motor* connector which serves as both a charging connector and a high-power driver for a drive assembly. 

= Sensor Connector =

The sensor connector is a watertight DB9 male connector that contains +5V DC @ 100ma power, a 0-5V analog input, two digital control lines, and a bidirectional TTL serial port.

*Note: The current connector implements a TTL-level serial port, and CANNOT handle RS-232 signal levels.  We may address RS-232 devices in future revisions, but currently, only TTL communication is supported*

= Motor Connector =

The motor connector is a DB15 male connector that contains DC charging leads to the internal battery, three motor phases to drive a brushless DC motor (~12V @ 10A), and lines for a high-torque steeering servo (5V @ 2A).  In order to handle these currents, the pins on the connector are paired together, so each high-current load is split across two pins.
